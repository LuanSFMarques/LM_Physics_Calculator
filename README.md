# LM Physics Calculator

-what is it about?-

a: LM Physics Calculator is a tiny project made by me using tkinter (python).
Its functionality is to calculate basic unit conversions and perform basic operations involving physics variables (such as speed, acceleration, time, etc...). All the code used in the program is available in the '.py' file, in case you need to study or even implement features yourself!

-how to start the program?-

a: just open the '.exe' file!

*All stuff*
